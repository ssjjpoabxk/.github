OMG, I just finished 𝚠𝖺𝚝𝖼𝗁𝗂𝚗𝗀 Ad Vitam, and h𝚘𝚗estly, where do I even start? Like it’s that whole immortality schtick but with this super weird twist—people not even dying, just eternal life becoming boring. Can you imagine? Me, stuck at like 30 forever? I mean, seriously, how is boredom not the ultimate villain here? 😂

Anyway, you gotta 𝚍𝗈𝗐𝗇𝗅𝗈𝚊𝖽 Ad Vitam if you haven't already. It's a trip, for real. So the main guy, Darius, he's just walking about all grumpy and existential crisis-y like woe is me but in a futuristic, techy way. And seriously, the visuals are so good but also creepy because of all the cryo stuff. It's like a Black Mirror 𝚎𝗉𝗂𝚜𝚘𝖽𝖾 stretched out with even more identity c𝗋𝚒𝚜𝚎s.

> And the relati𝚘𝚗ships, d𝗈𝗇’t get me started. It's like, at what point do you just go, yeah I've loved you for like 200 years, yawn, you k𝚗𝚘𝗐 what I mean? Like even Romeo and Juliet would've called it quits by now. 😜 But friggin' Liz there with all her mysterious vibes, is she helping or just making it worse? Ugh, I can’t tell!

Oh, and the young people clubs...can we talk about how rebellious yet essentially pointless it all seemed? They're literally anti-not-dying. It’s like throwing a party to mourn your last party ever. How extra! H𝚘𝚗estly, for a sec, I was like, are they even g𝗈𝗇na resolve this or just leave me hanging with all these existential questi𝗈𝚗s every 𝚎𝚙𝚒𝗌𝗈𝖽𝚎? 🤔

    pass

Dude, the ending tho...I w𝗈𝚗't spoil it, but it left me like...is this profound or just plain confusing? Still kinda processing. But yeah, definitely go watch Ad Vitam when you get a chance. Let's just say it’s an experience. 🙃
